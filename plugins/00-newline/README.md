## 00-newline

This is a somewhat "silly" plugin, which is run at the very beginning of the
initialization sequence and just prints a newline character.

This can be handy when your terminal emulator or "login tools" print some
messages, but you want the ouput of your plugins and the first shell prompt
clearly separated.
