# simple and sane built-in prompt that should work "everywhere". And try to
# make sure that nothing else "disturbs" such terminals ...

# The PS3 and PS4 prompts are compatible with sh(1) and bash(1), too, and
# "unlikely" to get overwritten by themes. So let's export them to be useful
# in sub-shells as well!
# NOTE: PS1 is set by themes, and PS2 is set to a ZSH-specific setting here in
# this file. So we DO NOT export those!
export PS3 PS4

# NOTE: The theme itself is read in by the ax.zsh script itself: last and into
# the global context (code for the cache file is generated as required).
